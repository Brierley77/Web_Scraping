# Web_Scraping

In this repository I am showing all my wbscraping notebooks. 

The first notebook 'Web Sraping' is me following a website tutorial. I am just keeping it simple here to understand the basics. 

The second is myself pushing my learning by trying to webscrape a real website for weather data. This is still on-going. I am trying to increase my webscraping skills to start gathering some really nice datasets of my own.
