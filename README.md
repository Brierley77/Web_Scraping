# Web_Scraping

In this repository I am showing all my wbscraping notebooks. 

The first notebook 'Web Sraping' is me following a website tutorial. I am just keeping it simple here to understand the basics. 

The second 'Own Web Scraping' is myself pushing my learning by trying to webscrape a real website for weather data. This is still on-going. I am trying to increase my webscraping skills to start gathering some really nice datasets of my own. This is an ongoing project that I am going to try and run everyday / ever couple of days to build my own weather data base. I am going to try and learn how to then push this into my own SQL database. 

Currently trying to make this python script run every week. I want to be able to run this code through the windows task scheduler. But I am having issues / can't get this to work at the moment. I believe I need to use something like pycharm to help here. My next goal is to learn how to automate this data being gathered.
